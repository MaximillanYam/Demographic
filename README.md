# About the project
A boiler plate project that aims to develop a backend service for a client to query a csv file to enter information about a person's name, age, and social security number. The user can then query the csv file to retrieve information about a person or delete the person from the csv file.

# Installation 
Download the files 'Client.java', 'ClientHandler.java', 'Server.java', 'ServerHandler.java'. Compile all files in the directory using javac *.java, and then open two terminals.
In one terminal run the command 'java Server', and then run the command 'java ClientHandler'

# Next steps 
Transform into full stack application
